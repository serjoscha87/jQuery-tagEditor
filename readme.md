jQuery-tagEditor - Strict autocomplete tags
============================================

This is a fork. For the original source and tribute go to
https://goodies.pixabay.com/jquery/tag-editor/demo.html
or
https://github.com/Pixabay/jQuery-tagEditor

Changes in comparision to the original:

**autocomplete**
Tags need to be valid: Valid tags are those that are suggested by the autocomplete and NOTHING more.
This Version can prevent the user from choosing none-valid Tags / creating own ones.
This means **only** tags that are predefined and shown in the autocomplete menu can be chosen
